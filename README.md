# node-liri

LIRI is an application just like Apple's SIRI, but instead of a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition interface. It takes in parameters in a command line Node and gives back data to the user.

This application uses: Javascript & JQuery, Node, and Twitter, Spotify and OMDB API's.

This application was made for a homework assignment in the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.
